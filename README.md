**False-Data Injection Attacks on Remote Distributed Consensus Estimation 📡📊**

It focuses on the **security challenges** in remote distributed consensus estimation, particularly in systems where sensors transmit data to estimators via wireless networks. It investigates how **false-data injection (FDI) attacks** can compromise such systems by stealthily altering sensor data to degrade performance while remaining undetected. 🚨🛡️

**Key Features 🌟**
- Novel Joint-FDI Attack Model : Introduces a model where false data are injected into both communication channels and estimators, bypassing anomaly detectors. 💡🔒  
- Trade-off Analysis : Evaluates the balance between attack stealthiness and performance degradation. ⚖️📈  
- Performance Metrics : Utilizes relative entropy to assess attack stealthiness and effectiveness. 📐🕵️
